	<h1>Postcard Mockup Feedback</h1>
	<h2>for Lauren Jin (I know there's another one but due to a series of circumstances this is what we're doing)</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>You may want to consider trying different quotes with your designs, as ultimately that is what the end product will be.</li>
		<li>The designs are also nice, but I’m not sure if we’re required to use actual images for the project, so you may want to check that as well. Images would also be nice in general to help provide some context for the quotes you’re using (it feels kind of like a powerpoint-theme right now). </li>
		<li>I’ve noticed for both the all the designs the image itself seems to fundamentally change. The transition might be a little choppy if that’s the case, although an easy way around this is to have both images be cropped versions of a bigger image.</li>
