		<ul>
			<li>The scrolling function is interesting, but it ultimately does not make or break the recipe website. I most likely won't be able to feasibly accomplish my vision in the time alotted, so I could probably try for something a little simpler.</li>
			<li>The use of bold to highlight things like the main elements of an instruction was a nice touch. If anything I will increase the spacing between lines in the ingredients list to help distinguish ingredients.</li>
			<li>A little bit of extra description of the salmon might help, since 'cooked salmon' is considerably more vague than the rest of the ingredient list. Even a note like 'any salmon is fine' could work.</li>
			<li>Can be a little content heavy, I might want to change up the spacing or the way I handle the pictures.</li>
